			<p>I'm Chia-Yu, a Master's student in <a href=http://www.cs.nccu.edu.tw/~jonesyu>Innovative User Interface Lab</a> at National Chengchi University. I received my Bachelor's degree in Business Administration, with a double-major in Digital Contents and Technologies and a minor in Computer Science.</p>
			<p>My research mainly focuses on Human-centered Design and Haptics. I'm particularly interested in observing <em>how people interact with the others or the artifacts</em>, <em>defining the problem by unveiling their real need</em>, and <em>improving the techonology to fulfill the need, through and by research and design</em>.</p>
			<p>I'm also a techno music enthusiast, a cat lover, a poet, and a spirit-of-open-source believer.</p>

				<h2>PinchFun</h2>
				<p class=date>User Research, Interface Prototyping<br/>Dec 2015 â€“ May 2016</p>
				<p>I'm fascinated by creating technologies that can make a impact on people.</p>
				<p>PinchFun is a cooperative fine motor training game for preschool children with developmental delay. Developmental delay children can make progress through early intervention and training. However, from the field observation in the early intervention center and interviews with occupational therapist and parents, we found that (1) Traditional fine motor training techniques are monotone and bore kids easily, and (2) The training cannot continue at home.</p>
				<p>We re-design the training into a interactive game called PinchFun to improve the training effect. To entertain and attract children, PinchFun integrates the tangible controller and the virtual interactive game to optimize learning impact and gaming experience. To enhance parents involvement and make the game more immersive, the game mission is designed to be completed cooperatively.</p>
				<p>We conduct several user evaluations in two special schools in Taipei, and iterated the prototypes according to the preliminary results. The qualitative results showed that the gaming feedback brings fun and activates learning motivation. Children showed excitement during gameplay; they would react according to each other's performance and stay more focused on the game than in traditional training.</p>
